# Credit-Risk-Predictor
Credit risk is the possibility of a loss resulting from a borrower's failure to repay a loan or meet contractual obligations. Traditionally, it refers to the risk that a lender may not receive the principal and interest owed, which results in an interruption of cash flows and increased costs for collection.
It's a data science project focused on predicting credit risk using machine learning, featuring data preprocessing, model training, and insightful visualizations.
It uses the followig three models to predict the risk that the borrower will return the credit or not:
- KNN(K Nearest Neighbour)
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
