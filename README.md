# Credit-Risk-Predictor
Credit risk is the possibility of a loss resulting from a borrower's failure to repay a loan or meet contractual obligations. Traditionally, it refers to the risk that a lender may not receive the principal and interest owed, which results in an interruption of cash flows and increased costs for collection.
